Weird that it still shows older posts. Maybe this will work? I'm starting to get really confused on what I've done and what works. I might just scrap the project and start from the docs again.

![](/static/content/posts/images/diaryphotogalleryvertical_fs-s91-087_001_default.jpg)

Ok, so the old images are not being located. That's ok. as long as this shows up I think we're heading in the right direction!
